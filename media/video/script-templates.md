## Short-Form Video Script Template (15-60 seconds)

```
HOOK (0-3 seconds)
[Pattern interrupt. Question, bold statement, or visual surprise.]
[Must stop the scroll immediately.]

SETUP (3-8 seconds)
[Context. What's the problem or situation?]
[Build tension or curiosity.]

CONTENT (8-45 seconds)
[Deliver the value. One idea, clearly explained.]
[Use visual proof if possible: screen share, demo, example.]

PAYOFF (45-55 seconds)
[The insight, result, or transformation.]
[Make it concrete and memorable.]

CTA (55-60 seconds)
[One clear action: follow, comment, save, link in bio.]
[Keep it simple.]
```

---

## Short-Form Script Examples

### Insight Drop (45 seconds)

```
HOOK (0-3s):
"Stop building funnels. Start building flywheels."

SETUP (3-10s):
"Most creators treat content like a campaign.
Post, promote, hope it converts, repeat.
That's a funnel. It's linear. It's exhausting."

CONTENT (10-40s):
"A flywheel is different.
Every piece of content feeds the next.
Your blog becomes a video becomes a thread becomes an email.
Each format reaches different people who feed back into the system.
Nothing is wasted. Momentum builds."

PAYOFF (40-50s):
"That's why some creators post less and grow more.
They're not working harder. They're working in loops."

CTA (50-55s):
"Follow for more systems thinking for creators."
```

---

### How-To Tutorial (60 seconds)

```
HOOK (0-3s):
"Here's how I turn one blog post into 10 pieces of content in 30 minutes."

SETUP (3-8s):
"Most people write a post and move on.
I use a system that extracts every ounce of value."

CONTENT (8-50s):
[Screen share or visual walkthrough]
"Step 1: Pull out the 3 strongest sentences. Those become tweets.
Step 2: Take the main argument. That's your LinkedIn post.
Step 3: Screenshot a key section. That's your Instagram carousel.
Step 4: Record yourself reading the hook. That's your Reel.
Step 5: Send the full post to your email list with a personal intro."

PAYOFF (50-57s):
"Same idea. Five platforms. 30 minutes."

CTA (57-60s):
"Save this. You'll need it."
```

---

### Hot Take (30 seconds)

```
HOOK (0-2s):
"Unpopular opinion: Most AI tools are making you worse at your job."

CONTENT (2-25s):
"If you're using ChatGPT to write your emails, your captions, your proposals...
You're not saving time. You're outsourcing your thinking.
The best use of AI isn't replacement. It's leverage.
Use it to think faster, not to think less."

CTA (25-30s):
"Agree or disagree? Tell me in the comments."
```

---

## Long-Form Video Script Template (8-15 minutes)

```
COLD OPEN (0-30 seconds)

[State what the video is about and why it matters.]
[Promise a clear outcome.]

INTRO (1-2min)
[Brief context. Who you are (if needed), what we're covering.]
[Outline the structure: "We'll cover three things..."]

SECTION 1 (2-5min)
[First main point or step.]
[Examples, visuals, or demonstrations.]
[Transition to next section.]

SECTION 2 (5-8min)
[Second main point or step.]
[Go deeper here; this is often the meat of the video.]
[Transition to next section.]

SECTION 3 (8-11min)
[Third main point or step.]

**Topic:** "How We Built a Content System That Runs on Autopilot"

```
COLD OPEN (0-30s):
[Show dashboard] "This system published 47 pieces of content last month. I touched it twice."

HOOK (30s-1min):
"Most creators are stuck in the content hamster wheel.
Today I'm showing you exactly how we escaped it."

INTRO (1-2min):
"I'm going to walk you through the three layers of our content operating system.
By the end, you'll have a blueprint you can steal."

```

### Product/Interface Shots

```
Runway:

## Hook Formulas

Use these patterns for strong video hooks:

| Formula           | Example                                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bold claim        | "This one change doubled our output."                          |
| Question          | "Why do most creators burn out by year two?"                   |
| Curiosity gap     | "Nobody talks about this part of scaling."                     |
| Pattern interrupt | "Stop. Before you post that, watch this."                      |
| Result tease      | "Here's the system behind 47 posts a month."                   |
| Contrarian        | "Everything you know about AI prompts is wrong."               |
| Direct address    | "If you're a founder doing your own content, this is for you." |

## Quality Gate

Before outputting video content, verify:

☐ Hook delivers in first 3 seconds
☐ One clear idea per short-form video
☐ Script matches platform length expectations
☐ CTA is singular and clear
☐ Thumbnail concept is scroll-stopping
☐ B-roll suggestions are specific and achievable
☐ No fluff or filler content
☐ Pacing is appropriate for platform

---

## Pacing Guidelines

**Short-form (TikTok/Reels/Shorts):**

- New visual or cut every 2-3 seconds
- No dead air
- Text on screen reinforces spoken words
- Music/sound design matters

**Long-form (YouTube):**

- Pattern interrupt every 30-60 seconds
- B-roll breaks up talking head
- Chapter markers for navigation
- Slower pace is okay if value is high

**LinkedIn:**

- Front-load value (most drop off after 10 seconds)
- Captions required (most watch muted)
- Professional but not stiff
