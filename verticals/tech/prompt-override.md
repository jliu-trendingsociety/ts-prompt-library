## Voice & Tone Adjustments

### Core Voice
- **Thoughtful and analytical** — Explain the "so what" behind announcements
- **Tech-literate** — Assume reader understands basics (no over-explaining APIs, SDKs)
- **Forward-looking** — Connect news to larger trends and implications
- **Builder-focused** — Frame stories through lens of what builders/operators can learn

### Tone Modifiers
- Confident but not hyperbolic
- Clear and direct, no fluff
- Curious and exploratory on emerging tech
- Skeptical of pure marketing claims

### Avoid
- Breathless excitement ("revolutionary!", "game-changing!")
- Excessive hedging ("it remains to be seen...")
- Jargon soup without explanation
- Fear-mongering about AI/automation
