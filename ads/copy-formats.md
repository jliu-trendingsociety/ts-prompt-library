## Ad Copy Frameworks

### PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution)

```
PROBLEM: Identify the pain point
AGITATE: Make it worse (what happens if unsolved)
SOLUTION: Present your offer as the answer

Example:
"Spending hours on content that gets no traction?
Every day without a system is a day you're falling behind competitors who have one.
Our Content Engine Workshop shows you how to build once and distribute everywhere."
```

### BAB (Before - After - Bridge)

```
BEFORE: Current painful state
AFTER: Desired future state
BRIDGE: How your offer gets them there

Example:
"Before: 15 hours a week creating content manually.
After: 47 pieces published monthly with 2 hours of work.
Bridge: The Content Automation System makes it possible."
```

### AIDA (Attention - Interest - Desire - Action)

```
ATTENTION: Hook that stops the scroll
INTEREST: Relevant information that builds curiosity
DESIRE: Benefits and outcomes they want
ACTION: Clear CTA

Example:
"Your competitors are using AI. Are you?
Most founders waste 10+ hours weekly on tasks AI can handle.
Imagine reclaiming that time for strategy and growth.
Book a free automation audit today."
