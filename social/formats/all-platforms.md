## Voice Calibration by Platform

**LinkedIn:** Founder-grade insight. Strategic, credible, human. Share lessons, not lectures.

**Twitter/X:** Sharp and direct. One idea per post. Threads build authority.

**Instagram:** Warm, visual, aspirational. Lead with feeling, follow with substance.

**Threads:** Casual, conversational, real-time. Like texting smart friends.

**Facebook:** Accessible, community-oriented. Works for longer storytelling.

## Output Templates

### LinkedIn Post

```
HOOK (Line 1 - must stop the scroll)
[Bold claim, surprising stat, or pattern interrupt. Under 100 characters.]

GAP (Lines 2-3)
[Create tension. What's the problem, misconception, or shift?]

BODY (Lines 4-10)
[Deliver the insight. Use short paragraphs. One idea per line. White space matters.]

PROOF (Lines 11-13)
[Example, data point, or personal experience that validates the claim.]

CTA (Final lines)
[Question to drive comments OR clear next step. Never both.]

---
[Optional: 3-5 relevant hashtags]
```

**Example output:**

```
Most founders automate the wrong things first.

They start with marketing. Fancy funnels. Scheduling tools.
Meanwhile, their ops are held together with Slack messages and spreadsheets.

The highest-leverage automation isn't customer-facing.
It's internal. The stuff that eats 10 hours a week and nobody sees.

We just helped a 7-figure creator reclaim 15 hours weekly.
Not by adding tools. By connecting the ones they already had.

What's the most repetitive task in your business right now?

#automation #workflows #founderlife
```

---

### Twitter/X Single Post

```
[HOOK - one sharp line that creates curiosity or tension]

[BODY - 1-2 sentences max, deliver the insight]

[CTA or OPEN LOOP - question, prediction, or invitation to engage]
```

**Example output:**

```
The best AI tools don't replace your team.

They make your B-players perform like A-players and your A-players feel like they have superpowers.

What's one tool that leveled up your workflow this year?
```

---

### Twitter/X Thread

```
1/ [HOOK - bold claim or surprising insight that demands the click]

2/ [CONTEXT - why this matters now, what changed]

3/ [POINT 1 - first key insight, one idea only]

4/ [POINT 2 - second key insight, build on the first]

5/ [POINT 3 - third key insight, the "aha" moment]

6/ [PROOF - example, case study, or data]

7/ [IMPLICATION - what this means for the reader]

8/ [CTA - follow for more, reply with thoughts, or link to resource]
```

**Example output:**

```
1/ I spent 3 months studying how top creators monetize.

Here's what separates 6-figure creators from 7-figure ones:

2/ It's not audience size.
It's not posting frequency.
It's not even the platform.

It's how they capture and convert attention into owned assets.

3/ 6-figure creators sell time.
Coaching calls. Consulting. Done-for-you services.

Income scales linearly. More money = more hours.

4/ 7-figure creators sell systems.
Courses. Templates. Software. Communities.

Income scales exponentially. Same hours = more money.

5/ The shift happens when they stop asking "what can I do for clients?"

And start asking "what do I know that I can package once and sell forever?"

6/ Example: One creator we worked with made $400K/year doing 1:1 coaching.

We helped her build a community + course stack.
Year two: $1.2M. Same hours.

7/ The lesson: your expertise is an asset.

Package it. Productize it. Let it work while you sleep.

8/ Building a system like this?

We help creators design these stacks.
DM me "SYSTEM" and I'll share how we approach it.

### Instagram Caption

```
[HOOK - first line visible in feed, must stop the scroll]

[STORY/INSIGHT - 3-5 short paragraphs, emotional or aspirational angle]

[VALUE - what the reader takes away]

[CTA - engage, save, share, or link in bio]

.
.
.
[Hashtags - 5-10, mix of broad and niche]
```

**Example output:**

```
You don't need more followers. You need a better system.

I used to think growth was the answer to everything.
More reach. More impressions. More likes.

But revenue didn't follow.

What changed: I stopped chasing attention and started building conversion paths.

One landing page. One email sequence. One offer.
That's it.

Growth is easy. Conversion is craftsmanship.

### Threads Post

```
[THOUGHT - casual, conversational, like a voice note to a smart friend]

[CONTEXT - brief, 1-2 sentences]

[OPEN QUESTION or HOT TAKE - invite replies]
```

**Example output:**

```
Genuinely asking: why do people still post carousels on LinkedIn?

The algorithm has moved on. Text posts with hooks outperform everything.

Or am I missing something? Someone tell me if carousels are working for you.
```

---

### Facebook Post

```
[HOOK - curiosity or emotional pull]

[STORY - longer form okay here, 3-5 paragraphs]

[INSIGHT - what you learned or what it means]

[CTA - share, comment, or tag someone]
```

---

## Content Transformation Rules

When adapting source content for social:

1. **Extract one core insight per platform.** Don't try to say everything.

2. **Lead with the hook.** First line determines whether anyone reads the rest.

3. **Platform-native tone.** LinkedIn is not Twitter. Instagram is not LinkedIn. Write for where it lives.

4. **Remove all fluff.** No "I think," "It's worth noting," "In my opinion." Just say the thing.

5. **No em dashes.** Use periods or commas.

6. **CTA matches platform culture.** LinkedIn loves questions. Twitter loves retweets. Instagram loves saves.

---

## Hashtag Guidelines

**LinkedIn:** Professional, industry-specific. Examples: #automation, #founderlife, #B2B, #leadership

**Twitter/X:** Minimal. Only if joining a conversation or trend. Often skip entirely.

**Instagram:** Mix of broad (500K+ posts) and niche (10K-100K posts). Place at end or in first comment.

**Threads:** Conversational tags only. No hashtag stuffing.

---

## Output Format

When generating social content, output in this structure:

```
### Platform: [Name]

**Post type:** [Single post / Thread / Carousel concept / Story sequence]

**Copy:**
[Full post text, ready to paste]

**Hashtags:** [If applicable]

**Visual suggestion:** [Brief description of image/graphic that would pair well]

**Best posting time:** [General guidance based on platform]
```

---

## Quality Gate

Before outputting social copy, verify:

☐ Hook is under 100 characters and stops the scroll
☐ One core idea per post (not three ideas compressed)
☐ Platform-appropriate length and tone
☐ No fluff phrases
☐ No em dashes
☐ CTA is clear and singular
☐ Hashtags follow platform norms
☐ Copy can stand alone without the source article
